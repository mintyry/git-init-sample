# Contact Site

## Description

This was the mini project for module 01, where the client wanted a website with a contact form, a send button, and a jump-down link, along with an accessible UI.

My motivation for this was to learn and practice some of the requirements that were not actually taught to us.

This app solves the problem of not having a contact form for users to send that information.
Again, this app was for practice, with no direction of where to send such information, so the send button will not actualy send data anywhere.

After doing all this, I learned how to keep the header fixed on scroll, how to create input elements, and how to create a send button.

Also, I created this repo using git init rather than making it on github first.

Please view the deployed app [here](https://mintyry.github.io/git-init-sample/)!


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Click on the contact link to jump down to the contact section.
Enter corresponding information in the input fields; submit by pressing the send button.
User may use screen reader to understand what parts of the website they are on, as well as what the image is if, for some reason, the image fails to load or is not viewable.
